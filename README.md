<h1>React + pixi.js</h1>
<p>Replaces react.render loop with canvas drawing engine from pixi.js</p>
<p>Very simple template, just setup the render loop, and architecture for extension.</p>
<p>Mr snake isn't even a react component yet :(</p>
<pre>npm i --save && npm run watch</pre>
<hr>
<p>2 components(buttons) that control the render loop by proxy of reacts event system</p>
